- All code must be TypeScript. Avoid `any` type unless justified.
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` in components.
- Follow Nuxt's recommended folder and naming conventions.
- Keep functions focused and manageable (under 50-75 lines).
- Use try-catch for async operations; leverage Nuxt error utilities.
