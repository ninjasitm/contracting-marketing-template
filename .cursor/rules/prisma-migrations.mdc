- Always pull the latest schema from the remote database using `pnpm run prisma:pull` before making schema changes.
- Create proper migrations with descriptive names using `pnpm run prisma:migrate -- --name descriptive_migration_name`.
- Apply migrations to the development database with `pnpm run prisma:migrate:dev`.
- Maintain a corresponding TypeScript model definition file in `src/models/` for each Prisma model.
- Ensure model files include proper imports, interfaces matching the schema, CRUD methods, and exports.
- Export all model files from the main models index file for easy importing elsewhere.
- After schema changes, update corresponding model files, affected services, and run tests.
- When creating new Prisma models, add TypeScript model files and update the models index file.
