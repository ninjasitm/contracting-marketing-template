# SEO & Performance Optimization

## SEO Implementation

- Use `useSeoMeta` for meta tags (title, description, Open Graph)
- Use `useHead` for additional head elements
- Implement proper meta descriptions and titles for all pages
- Include Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Use structured data where appropriate

## Performance Guidelines

- Use `useAsyncData` or `useFetch` for data fetching with proper loading states
- Implement skeleton loaders for async operations
- Optimize images with `@nuxt/image` module when applicable
- Use lazy loading for non-critical content
- Minimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary imports

## Loading States

- Show loading indicators during async operations
- Disable form inputs during submission
- Provide visual feedback for user actions
- Handle error states gracefully

## Browser Compatibility

- Prioritize modern browsers
- Use feature detection for newer APIs
- Provide graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
