- Never import server-only code in client components
- Don't import from `~/server/` directory in client components
- Don't import modules with `.server.ts` extension in client components
- Use API endpoints in `~/server/api/` to expose server functionality
- Use Nuxt composables like `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` for server interactions
- Create shared types in `~/types/` for cross-boundary use
- Use `.server.ts` extension for server-only modules
