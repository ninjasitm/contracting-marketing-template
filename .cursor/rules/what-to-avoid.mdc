- No deprecated Nuxt/Vue features.
- No global CSS outside Tailwind or `assets/scss/`.
- No direct DOM manipulation; use Vue's reactivity and refs.
- No custom solutions for problems already solved by core libraries.
- No inconsistent naming for events or handlers.
- No server code imports in client components; see server-client-separation.mdc.
- **NEVER use Awesome* components** - these have been removed. Use shadcn `Ui*` components instead.
- No `useAwesomeScreen()` - use `useScreen()` composable instead.
- No `AwesomeLayoutPageNavbarMenu` types - use `LayoutPageNavbarMenu` instead.
