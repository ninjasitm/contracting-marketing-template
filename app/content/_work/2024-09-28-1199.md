description: 1199SEIU is a labor-management fund that provides benefits to
  healthcare workers and their families. We were brought on to migrate them from
  their previous NationBuilder installation into a more stable, flexible and
  scalable solution that allows them to add new features and make changes to
  support their union members.

problem:
  title: Problem
  description: 1199SEIU's legacy website, built on NationBuilder, was constrained
    by its inflexible architecture and limited customization options. This
    hindered the union's ability to introduce innovative features, such as a
    mobile app for members or region-specific content. Recognizing the need for
    a more agile and adaptable platform, 1199SEIU sought a solution that would
    enable a seamless migration of their existing data while granting them full
    ownership and control over their digital presence.
solution:
  title: Solution
  description: >-
    1.  **Migrate to a Modern, Customizable CMS:** We migrated to a Concrete5
    solution that allowed for complete control over the data, feature
    implementation and maintenance. This also allowed us to implement a
    collaborative workflow for content creation and approval making site updates
    easy and seamless
        
    2.  **Prioritize Mobile-First Design:** We implemented a responsive mobile
    first design experience to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to different
    screen sizes and devices. Our main performance consideration was to optimize
    website speed and loading times for mobile users.
        
    3.  **Implement a Member Portal:**
        
        *   **Personalized Dashboards:** Provide members with access to their specific information and benefits.
            
        *   **Secure Communication:** Enable members to securely communicate with union representatives.
            
        *   **Online Forms:** Allow members to submit forms, applications, and requests online.

            
    4.  **Develop a Region-Specific Content Strategy:** The new solution allowed
    the union to create content tailored to the needs and interests of members
    in different regions. This allowed us to optimize website content for local
    search terms to improve visibility, highlight local events, resources, and
    contact information.
        
    5.  **Implement APIs for a Mobile Application:** The new platform allowed us
    to connect the website to the union's CRM system for member data management
    and communication. Additionally we implemented an API that enabled us to
    sync member data between the website and the membership database.
        
    6.  **Invest in Ongoing Maintenance and Support:** We have kept the
    website's software and plugins up-to-date to ensure security and
    performance. Additionally, we have a dedicated support team available to
    address technical issues promptly. Finally, we provide training to staff
    members on how to effectively manage and update website content.
        

    By implementing these solutions, 1199SEIU has benefited from a more
    flexible, customizable, and user-friendly website that better serves the
    needs of its members and supports the union's goals for the past 10 years.
