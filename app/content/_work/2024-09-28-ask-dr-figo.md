description: Ask Dr. FIGO project is a free, anonymous website that enables
  visitors to ask questions about sexual and reproductive health and get
  personalised information from OBGYNs in their own language. Launched as a
  pilot in Ethiopia in July 2021, the project will be scaled to other lower- and
  middle-income countries in the future.

  title: Problem
  description: >-
    Ask Dr. Figo aimed to create a platform where individuals could ask
    questions related to sexual health and well-being. However, the project
    faced a significant challenge: many potential users were located in
    countries where discussing such topics or seeking this information could be
    illegal or socially taboo. This raised serious privacy and safety concerns
    for users.


    Key issues included:


    1.  Ensuring user privacy and anonymity
        
    2.  Providing geographically relevant and legally compliant content
        
    3.  Managing sensitive information across different cultural and legal
    contexts
        
    4.  Connecting users with appropriate medical professionals securely

    To address these challenges, a comprehensive web platform was developed with
    the following key features:


    1\. **Privacy-First Design**: The platform was built to collect minimal
    personally identifiable information (PII) from users.


    2\. **Geolocation and Geofenced Content**: Content is tailored and
    restricted based on the user's location to ensure legal compliance and
    cultural sensitivity.


    3\. **Multi-Language Support**: The platform supports multiple languages
    with country-specific translations.


    4\. **Doctor Portal**: A secure area for medical professionals to answer
    questions relevant to their expertise.


    5\. **Admin Portal**: A backend system for managing content, translations,
    and doctor accounts.


    6\. **Emergency Exit Feature**: A quick exit button that redirects users to
    a neutral website for safety.
