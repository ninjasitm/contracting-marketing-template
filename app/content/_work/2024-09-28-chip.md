    ### Low Code MVP


    For the initial proposed solution we were able to automate and streamline
    the workflow by:


    1.  Implementing an automated matching system using Google Scripts
        
    2.  Integrating various platforms (Constant Contact, OnceHub, Google Sheets)
    for seamless data flow
        
    3.  Automating email communications for scheduling and confirmations
        
    4.  Creating a professional portal for profile management
        
    5.  Exploring the possibility of a standalone platform with a mobile app
        

    ### Scalable Rebuild


    After gathering feedback and learning from the MVP phase, we were able to
    build a highly flexible and scalable solution:


    1.  Designed the UX based on the findings from the MVP pilot
        
    2.  Deployed the solution to AWS Beanstalk for easy scalability
        
    3.  Continuous updates are provided and automated to a staging and
    production environment for testing to ensure stability and quality
